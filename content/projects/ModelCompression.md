Power controlling and scheduling are the most crucial tasks for any data centre administrator to balance supply and demand. Efficient and precise power consumption forecasting over a long period is always demanded by customers to maintain a sustainable environment, effective resource planning and cost/energy saving. But there are two problems with the state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms: 1) usage of stale/irregular trend, seasonality and cyclic components from the historical dataset that impacts the modelâ€™s accuracy. 2) Increased model size as the models are trained with the whole of the available historical dataset. In this patent, we propose a data-centric method to train a time-series model by extracting the most representative data segment from the whole dataset and then using this data segment to train an effective time-series model.
