An approach to predict firmware and software deployment maintenance time windows in servers. They utilize server update logs to extract and create a dataset containing features linked to historical firmware and software components' deployments. This dataset is used to train an XGBRegressor model to predict the deployment time of newer components with a low Mean Absolute deployment time error of 12.230 (Â±3.390) seconds across 1800 components. The predicted deployment times are summed up to calculate the final maintenance time window, which will be presented to server customers and server component update tools.
