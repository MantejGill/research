The inventors have developed a method for unsupervised segmentation of univariate time series data. They use motifs, shapelets, and anomalies to group similar patterns in the data, which can be used to label sensor data and create alerts. They have created a custom K-Means method that works better in the time series space than traditional clustering algorithms and does not require defining the number of clusters beforehand. This approach highlights implicit patterns in the data and provides a better understanding of the data.
