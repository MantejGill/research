The inventors address the problem of unsupervised segmentation of a univariate time series dataset by identifying different signatures or patterns in the time series data and then grouping them based on their similarity. This is solved by finding motifs, shapelets and anomalies in the data, which can be used by HPE server customers to label their sensor data to create alerts based on them, and by internal teams to understand their data better by highlighting these usually implicit patterns. The key innovation is the novel approach of finding motifs, shapelets and anomalies using a novel custom K-Means method to cluster time series data. This novel clustering method is derived from the existing K-Means Algorithm with the added advantage of not defining the number of clusters beforehand and works better in the time series space than traditional clustering algorithms.
