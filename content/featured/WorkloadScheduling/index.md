A solution to help data centre administrators schedule their workloads better, using sensor data from each serverâ€™s power supply. It is a two-step solution: forecasting the signal of a sensor followed by applying a novel approach to identify areas of over(hotspots) and under(coldspots) utilizations in the forecasted data. This helps data centre administrators plan their existing workloads efficiently and introduce new workloads at the optimum time periods.
