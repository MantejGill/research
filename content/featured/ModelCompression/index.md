The patent proposes a data-centric method to train time-series models for power consumption forecasting in data centers. The method addresses the problems with state-of-the-art algorithms by extracting the most representative data segment from the historical dataset and using it to train an effective model. This avoids using stale/irregular trend, seasonality, and cyclic components from the entire dataset that can impact the model's accuracy and reduce model size. Accurate power consumption forecasting is essential for maintaining a sustainable environment, effective resource planning, and cost/energy savings.
