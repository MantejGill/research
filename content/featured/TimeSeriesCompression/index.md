A novel solution to compress a univariate stationary time series dataset. This approach involves: finding common patterns (motifs) across a dataset to represent different subsequences of the time series dataset and then storing these representational patterns, along with their meta-data, as a compressed time-series dataset. The authors perform a comparative study with the different rates of compression achieved by the algorithm and its effects on the final model accuracy and note an accuracy reduction of 0.01% in MAPE with 30% compression saving; and a reduction of 0.1% when the compression saving was 90%.
