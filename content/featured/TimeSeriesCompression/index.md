The solution presented compresses a univariate stationary time series dataset by finding common patterns (motifs) across the dataset and storing them, along with metadata, as a compressed time-series dataset. The authors performed a study that showed a reduction in model accuracy of 0.01% in MAPE with 30% compression saving and 0.1% with 90% compression saving. The approach aims to provide significant compression while maintaining model accuracy, making it useful for storage and analysis of large datasets.
