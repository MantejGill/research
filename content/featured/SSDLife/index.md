The patent proposes an AutoML-based approach to monitor and determine the wear or performance degradation of an SSD in a data center. The approach continuously monitors the SSD's wear status and calculates the time left before the drive reaches 100% wear status, alerting the user about overuse. The method helps the user redistribute the load on a drive or reduce the number of write/erase cycles, ensuring the warranty remains intact. The inventors suggest that this approach can help address performance degradation issues in SSDs caused by Read-Write-Erase cycles and the limited wear provisioning mechanisms used by SSDs.
