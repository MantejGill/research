The authors propose a novel algorithm to address the issue of finding an optimal sampling rate for time-series data from server peripherals. Traditional methods store the same data at different sampling rates or test different resampling intervals, which can lead to high costs or missed patterns. The proposed algorithm can use data sampled at multiple intervals and adjust the sampling rate on-the-fly to improve predictions. The algorithm has shown to improve power data forecasts by up to 8.8 and on average by 2.6 for existing best-performing models across six HPE servers, providing better predictions and cost savings for analytics teams.
