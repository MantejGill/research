The inventors have developed a novel forecasting algorithm to accurately predict short-term maxima and minima (jaggedness) in server Power and CPU time-series datasets. Existing state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms fail to predict these fluctuations, leading to inaccurate results. The inventors' solution involves developing an add-on custom model to forecast jagged results in parallel with existing models. The algorithm has been tested on power supply datasets of seven servers, showing a reduction in average RMSE error by 0.556 when compared to state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms. The solution aims to improve the accuracy of short-term forecasting for servers.
