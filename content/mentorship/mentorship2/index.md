Clustering is a data mining technique that gathers one or more semantically related objects, groups them together and assigns an arbitrary label to them. The purpose of clustering is to identify hidden patterns in data that were not previously apparent. Clustering models can be naturally divided into hierarchic and non-hierarchic methods, depending on whether the similarity measures are top-down or bottom-up ones. The objective of this paper is grouping trajectories in order to find common locations crossed by people that rent a scooter to visit a city. The primary goal is to introduce the key unsupervised learning approaches for scooter trajectory clustering.
