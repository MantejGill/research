Thus, many teams store the same data at different sampling rates to avoid pattern loss, but this costs more. It's also common to test different resampling intervals to find the best one. However, once chosen, the sampling rate rarely changes throughout the ML solution's lifecycle, leading to missed patterns (for large sampling rates) or high computation costs (in case of small sampling rates). Therefore, the authors propose a novel algorithm that can use data sampled at multiple intervals, with an on-the-fly approach, to improve predictions. The proposed novel algorithm has improved RMSE values by up to 8.8, and on average by 2.6, for power data forecasts from existing best-performing models, across 6 HPE servers. Thus, the algorithm will create better predictions and save costs for analytics teams.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"01-01-2022","title":"An improved forecasting algorithm for Power and CPU data of a server","tech":["Data Centric AI","Time Series","Improving Forecasting"],"github":null,"external":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cr6Xczzc7oUeQI0x78ygbs2zpFm2hw5d/view?usp=sharing","company":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},"html":"<p>A server’s Power and CPU time-series datasets are jagged, containing numerous local maxima and minima that imply vital information about the workloads or applications executing on that server. Most existing state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms successfully predict long-term trends and seasonality but fail to predict short-term minima and maxima (jaggedness), producing inaccurate results for CPU and Power forecasting of servers. The inventors have devised a novel forecasting algorithm to address this problem by developing an add-on custom model to forecast the short-term jagged results, which runs parallel with the existing state-of-the-art time series models. They have proven the algorithm’s advantage by comparing it with state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms against power supply datasets of 7 servers, where they see a reduction in the average RMSE error by 0.556.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"01-01-2022","title":"An analytical method to improve the life of an SSD drive in a server","tech":["Remaining life of SSD Drive"],"github":null,"external":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cr6Xczzc7oUeQI0x78ygbs2zpFm2hw5d/view?usp=sharing","company":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},"html":"<p>Data Center SSDs are used for high-speed, high-performance data storage requirements. The SSD technology has improved tremendously over the years to incorporate techniques like wear levelling to efficiently reduce the number of write-erase cycles in SSDs. However, performance degradation over time is a significant issue in SSDs even today. Here we have an AutoML-based approach for determining the wear or performance degradation of an SSD. Most SSDs use NAND technology to store data. Once the drive is full, old data must be deleted to provision new data. This Read – Write – Erase cycle in an SSD results in the degradation of the oxide layer within the NAND. This degradation eventually makes an LBA invalid resulting in errors. SSDs have wear provisioning mechanisms where spare space is allocated to handle these invalid LBAs. However, wear provisioning is limited, and the drive starts failing as the number of NAND errors increases. The wear level is also used to determine if the drive qualifies for the manufacturer’s warranty. If the level of wear is high because of the drive's overuse, the drive's warranty becomes invalid. The inventors discuss a method that continuously monitors a drive's wear status and calculates the time left before the drive reaches 100% wear status to notify the user about the overuse of the drive. This can help the user redistribute the load on a drive or reduce the number of write/erase cycles, thereby ensuring that the warranty remains intact.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"01-01-2022","title":"Compression of a univariate time-series dataset using motifs","tech":["Data centric AI","Time series","Compression","Representation of time series"],"github":null,"external":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15WLmVfg7U43mwa40WN91ZVEICrL_uIzc/view?usp=sharing","company":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},"html":"<p>A novel solution to compress a univariate stationary time series dataset.

The authors perform a comparative study with the different rates of compression achieved by the algorithm and its effects on the final model accuracy and note an accuracy reduction of 0.01% in MAPE with 30% compression saving; and a reduction of 0.1% when the compression saving was 90%.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"01-01-2022","title":"Unsupervised segmentation of time series using motifs and shapelets","tech":["Data centric AI","Time series","Unsupervised Segmentation","Motifs, Shapelets and Anomalies","Custom novel K-Means algorithm"],"github":null,"external":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XeQXmp_lq832MX0xqD6q5H7DrkKca3-O/view?usp=sharing","company":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},"html":"<p>The inventors address the problem of unsupervised segmentation of a univariate time series dataset by identifying different signatures or patterns in the time series data and then grouping them based on their similarity. This is solved by finding motifs, shapelets and anomalies in the data, which can be used by HPE server customers to label their sensor data to create alerts based on them, and by internal teams to understand their data better by highlighting these usually implicit patterns. The key innovation is the novel approach of finding motifs, shapelets and anomalies using a novel custom K-Means method to cluster time series data. This novel clustering method is derived from the existing K-Means Algorithm with the added advantage of not defining the number of clusters beforehand and works better in the time series space than traditional clustering algorithms.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"01-01-2022","title":"Identifying hotspots and coldspots in forecasted power consumption data in an IT data center for workload scheduling","tech":["Data Centric AI","Time series","Coldspots and Hotspots","Workload Scheduling"],"github":null,"external":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18aEQPLHnlgvAlijgEl4vPdpIJz1zpFc1/view?usp=sharing","company":"Hewlett Packard Enterprise"},"html":"<p>A solution to help data centre administrators schedule their workloads better, using sensor data from each server’s power supply.
